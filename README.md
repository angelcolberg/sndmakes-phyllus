Team Manchaka prototype for SNDMakes ATX.  

Problem: Some news orgs gather ugc content manually though email, or google forms in order to create stories out of the content.These set of tasks are very manual and siloed across orgs. 
Idea: Simplifying, organizing and archiving this information for reuse and portability to other use cases would greatly enhance their content and workflows. 
Assumptions: UGC is gathered via forms that use image recognition apis that both archive and help to moderate media and text items submitted in order to alleviate workflow through automation, pre moderation filters, sentiment/bayesian analyses, etc. 
Prototype: Displays the scenario for searching and bucketing UGC items in order to perform an actionable item on the set like creating a page, sharing, tagging, and saving functionalities in order to alleviate newsrooms' current workflow of gathering via email and then entering, managing and archiving manually.
